The Magnificent Expedition of Percivl the Axolotl

Backstory:

The Axolotls of Urodela Village were on their daily worship to the Shrine of the Golden Blobfish, when they noticed that their sacred Blobfish has gone missing! The Golden Blobfish keeps the balance of life in the ocean, and without it in its proper place, the waters turn gray and the plants wither away. There are few who would commit such a devious act, and it is up to you to confront the thief. You, Percivl, must take up the trident and use it to eliminate obstacles or maneuver around them in your journey to bring the Blobfish back.
